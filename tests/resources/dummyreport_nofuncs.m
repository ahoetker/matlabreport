%% Problem 1
% This is the first dummy problem! I will do some simple operations in MATLAB.

A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9];
b = 7;
C = b.*A

%% Problem 2
% This time, I will do some LaTeX, and have a new section in the problem.
%
% The quadratic formula is,
%
% $$ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 -4ac}}{2a} $$
%
% Now let's try sections:

p = 5; q = 10;
p * q

%%
% Whew! What a bit of math that was! Moving on...

t = 100; s = 50;
t / s

%% Problem 3
% Let's take the log-mean of two quantities! We're actually doing this
% to test one of the dummy functions.

logmean(5, 10)

%% Problem 4
% FizzBuzz! We're going to fizzbuzz a bunch of numbers to test the function.

fizzbuzz(3)
fizzbuzz(5)
fizzbuzz(15)
fizzbuzz(8)
